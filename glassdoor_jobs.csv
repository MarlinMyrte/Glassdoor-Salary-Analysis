56,"Data Scientist, Product","About the role

After recently expanding Splice's offerings—first-party creator tools (Astra, Beatmaker, and Bridge) and education content (Skills)—we are looking for someone who can unlock greater understanding in how users adopt and engage with these areas of our product. We're interested in creating a unified, cohesive, and intuitive experience across our product ecosystem, so this role will require close collaboration with teams that oversee the core, cross-surface experience of our Sounds marketplace.

Day to day this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; survey analysis; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that data are accessible and easy to use for self-service reporting; and creating the essential metrics, reporting, and dashboards so the Product team and company have insight into the above-mentioned feature areas.

Why Splice?

Music starts at Splice. As a collection of artists, producers, creators and collaborators, Splice sweats every detail involved in the creative process. From our expansive library of content, to the tools we provide, to our company work culture, we're constantly evolving towards being the best advocates for our artists and employees. If you work at Splice you'll be asked, ""what does music mean to you?"" That's because music is at the core of everything we do. It's why we hire trailblazers to help us solve problems, navigate uncharted territory, and change the industry for the better. It's why we seek out diversity in who we hire, represent and collaborate with to ensure that we're growing towards a more inclusive and open minded reality. And it's why we hold ourselves accountable for our part in shaping music creation.

Skills we're looking for:
Data manipulation

We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.

Metric creation

This individual will be responsible for taking in loosely structured problems or objectives and devising useful metrics that drive us toward solutions. This process will require taking on a user-centric perspective to identify key behavioral patterns in our products and translate these into metrics that will be used in decision making—in a sense, choosing the optimal methodology while also thoughtfully constructing scalable and intuitive user interfaces for whatever metric or analysis is built.

Analysis

Most problems benefit from models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful product recommendations. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.

Technical requirements
Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data warehouse).
Hands-on experience with self-service analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).
Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
Familiarity with a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (preferably Python).
Exposure to a variety of data sets used for product analytics—chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, GA 360, or Snowplow) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce or subscription datasets).
Additional comments

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is definitely an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.

We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare. We launched Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. This solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population and democratize access to healthcare risk, making it more readily available and optimized through an intelligent marketplace. We free physicians to better allocate their time with patients, increase their autonomy, and provide incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence.

Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential
The First 90 Days….

We aren't the over-prescriptive types but to give you a sense of what we think we'll do in your first 3 months together:

First 30 Days: Get your hands dirty really understanding the universe of doctors we will be partnering with in our first year in the Direct Contracting model. Help us profile risk, identify opportunities for performance improvement, and lay the foundation for the work we will do in the year ahead. Take a crash course in the still new DCE model to ensure Pearl's continued leadership in understanding and explaining its value.

First 60 Days: Navigate the crucial launch window for the 2022 Performance Year where we will receive our first batch of data from our DCE partners and begin providing our service to our doctors. Become a subject matter expert on our datasets and define the measures we will use to guide our work throughout the performance year.

First 90 Days: Own the ongoing performance analysis and improvement process as we do both bespoke work with our practices and productize insights into the platform. Dig deep on the opportunities for growth within our existing universe of doctors and potential acquisitions for Performance Year 2.

Our Values

Our people are passionate about creating a company where technologists empower our military and civil servants to solve some of the hardest problems in government. Rebellion Defense is driven by our mission — but a set of core values binds us together: we hire by them, operate through them, and uphold them in every decision we make for ourselves and for our customers.
Your Rebel Team

Engineering:

The engineering team is focused on building products that apply artificial intelligence to analyze, secure, and deliver critical data to deter threats and drive mission success for our defense and national security customers.

How you'll make a difference in this role:

We are looking to add a Data Scientist to our team in Washington D.C., Seattle, WA, or Remote

As a Data Scientist, you will help to build the brain of our autonomous systems and platforms.

This role reports to an Engineering Manager

What your mission is:

Analyze and improve data ingestion for autonomous systems, identify opportunities for new data sources and metrics.
Identify areas of potential biases in data, and collaborate with the engineering team to build tools to mitigate these.
Build or incorporate models in focus areas such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and data generation (synthetic data, generative models) across multiple domains, incorporating the geospatial component where applicable.
Partner and build shared solutions with Geospatial team members and the broader AI/ML teams for cross-cutting capabilities.
Work on and with the product team to identify problem areas where AI/ML is a potential solution.

You may be fit for this role if your expertise aligns to:

Have experience in the autonomous vehicle industry, and/ or experience working on problems like computer vision and perception.

Understand and enjoy working with remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis to manipulate, extract, and analyze geospatial data from satellites and unmanned vehicles.
Are self-directed, detail-oriented, and enjoy figuring out the most important problem to work on.
Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
Prioritize getting the system working, but know when it is right to take on technical debt.

The Nature of our Work:

We are driving fast change to an extremely regulated industry. Many of the national security programs that are supported by Rebellion's products operate in secure environments and access to those spaces and the data in them may require an active personnel security clearance. It is a requirement of this position that you are able to obtain and hold a personnel security clearance at the right level.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
